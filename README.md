# Behaviorial Cloning Project

Overview
---
This repository contains starting files for the Behavioral Cloning Project.

In this project, deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks are used to clone driving behavior. The model is trained, validated and tested using Keras. The model will output a steering angle to an autonomous vehicle depending on the place of the road where the vehicle is located.

We have provided a simulator where you can steer a car around a track for data collection. The simulator can be downloaded from [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/fbf77062-5703-404e-b60c-95b78b2f3f9e/modules/6df7ae49-c61c-4bb2-a23e-6527e69209ec/lessons/46a70500-493e-4057-a78e-b3075933709d/concepts/1c9f7e68-3d2c-4313-9c8d-5a9ed42583dc).

To meet specifications, the project will require submitting five files: 
* model.py (script used to create and train the model)
* drive.py (script to drive the car - feel free to modify this file)
* model.h5 (a trained Keras model)
* a report writeup file (either markdown or pdf)
* video.mp4 (a video recording of your vehicle driving autonomously around the track for at least one full lap)

This README file describes how to output the video in the "Details About Files In This Directory" section.

### Dependencies
This lab requires:

* [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit)

The lab enviroment can be created with CarND Term1 Starter Kit. Click [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md) for the details.

The following resources can be found in this github repository:
* drive.py
* video.py
* writeup_template.md

## Details About Files In This Directory

### Collecting the data

There is a sample data set [here](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/December/584f6edd_data/data.zip). It is optional to use it. The simulator provides an option to drive the car in manual mode. It saves the images with their corresponding angle to a csv file. The 'data' folder should be located at the root of the repository and it should contain a 'IMG' folder with the corresponding data log file.

data _______ driving_log.csv
  |_________ IMG_______ image samples

### Training the model

run the model.py script within the conda environment by runnning "python model.py". This could take several minutes, it is recommended to use a computer with a GPU enabled to speed up the training process.

### `drive.py`

Usage of `drive.py` requires you have saved the trained model as an h5 file, i.e. `model.h5`. See the [Keras documentation](https://keras.io/getting-started/faq/#how-can-i-save-a-keras-model) for how to create this file using the following command:
```sh
model.save(filepath)
```

Once the model has been saved, it can be used with drive.py using this command:

```sh
python drive.py model.h5
```

The above command will load the trained model and use the model to make predictions on individual images in real-time and send the predicted angle back to the server via a websocket connection.

#### Saving a video of the autonomous agent

```sh
python drive.py model.h5 run1
```

The fourth argument, `run1`, is the directory in which to save the images seen by the agent. If the directory already exists, it'll be overwritten.

```sh
ls run1

The image file name is a timestamp of when the image was seen. This information is used by `video.py` to create a chronological video of the agent driving.

### `video.py`

```sh
python video.py run1
```

Creates a video based on images found in the `run1` directory. The name of the video will be the name of the directory followed by `'.mp4'`, so, in this case the video will be `run1.mp4`.

Optionally, one can specify the FPS (frames per second) of the video:

```sh
python video.py run1 --fps 48
```

Will run the video at 48 FPS. The default FPS is 60.
